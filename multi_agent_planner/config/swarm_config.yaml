swarm_description:
    # the relative positions of each robot in the swarm is computed from this initial config.
    # To make it easier, leave one robot at the origin and define the rest with respect to this one; the NUM_ROBOTS param is also computed from this list.
    # star config - 5 robots
    relative_positions: [0,0,  0.9,0,  0.9,0.9,  0.45,0.45,  0,0.9]
    # relative_positions: [0,0]
    # the number of robots that can act as leaders
    num_leaders: 5
    # this indexes into the relative_positions defined above. We want the indices of the robots that can act as leaders, starting with 0.
